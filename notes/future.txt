Honestly, I have no idea what to do now, since I let go of Solaris, Ladybug and Dino.
For now I'll stay away from developing anything on the Roblox platform, maybe I'll get into something different, who knows.
I've wanted for a longer time to get into web-dev stuff, and finally finish my website(s), I really need to revamp them...
Maybe I'll do a blog thingy where I just talk to myself, like right now, I don't expect enyone to really read this.

Well, let's see where time takes me.
