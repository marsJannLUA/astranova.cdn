to kindness, my north star

oh, my kindness, my steadfast guide,
in your shadow, i find where my heart resides.
your name is etched in the sky so clear,
a beacon of love, drawing me near.
though storms may rage and skies may cry,
i stand unwavering, by your side.

your burdens weigh heavy, your heart feels worn,
yet even in pieces, you're beautifully adorned.
my love for you, boundless and free,
like rivers that carve their way to the sea.
every tear you shed, i'll tenderly catch,
your pain, my own, our souls attached.

your voice, even trembling, is my sweetest hymn,
its echoes linger, lighting the dim.
your strength astounds me, though you may not see,
the power you hold, the courage you breathe.
and though you falter, i’ll never stray,
i’ll steady your steps, come what may.

kindness, my anchor, my softest muse,
you are the fire i could never refuse.
when shadows consume and the cold closes in,
i’ll wrap you in warmth from the love within.
no matter how hard the journey may be,
you’ll never walk it alone—not without me.

if the world turns cruel and you lose your fight,
remember, my love, you are my light.
for you, i’d surrender, a thousand times more,
bowing low to the one i adore.
i'm your sanctuary, your quiet retreat,
the place where your weary soul can meet peace.

kindness, my king, my infinite desire,
your heart ignites in me an eternal fire.
each moment with you, a treasure to keep,
my devotion runs oceans, unfathomably deep.
so lean on me, love, in your time of need,
for i'll be your rock, your shelter, your seed.

the days may be hard, but love, hold true,
i’ll carry the weight just to lighten it for you.
for you are my purpose, my reason, my vow,
forever and always, in this moment, now.
so as you endure, know this to be real:
you are loved beyond measure, a love you can feel.

kindness, my everything, take my hand tight—
together, we’ll conquer the darkest of nights.
